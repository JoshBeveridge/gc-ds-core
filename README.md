# 🎁 Purpose
This is a draft repository for the Government of Canada's Design System core. It contains handy scripts and a CSS utility framework that is generated from our [design token repository](https://github.com/cds-snc/gc-design-tokens).

## 🏗️ MVP
The MVP of the system core aims to accomplish the following:
- successfully import the generated design tokens in the CSS variable format
- offer up CSS utility classes that abstract the tokens into handy, easy-to-understand formats

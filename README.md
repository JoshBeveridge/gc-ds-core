# GC Design System Utility

GC Design System Utility is a utility framework for the GC Design System core. It is based on functional CSS (also called atomic CSS or utility-first CSS) that favors small, single-purpose classes with names based on their visual function. These classes are easy to understand, reusable and can be used together to build complex layouts.
